# Logan Strong

Hey, I'm Logan. I've always been fascinated with software - learning new platforms, figuring out how it works, breaking it, and learning how to build my own. I'm the coworker you call when your Excel workbook breaks. I'd like to build impactful tools and software full time. Check out some of my projects below.

Current favorite language: Java (specifically JavaFX because I really enjoy creating clean and functional UX/UI)


## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/logans-lab/portfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/logans-lab/portfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
