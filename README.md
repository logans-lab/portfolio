Hey, I'm Logan. I've always been fascinated with software - learning new platforms, figuring out how it works, breaking it, and learning how to build my own.</p>
<p>I'm the coworker you call when your Excel workbook breaks. I'd like to build impactful tools and software full time. Check out some of my projects below.</p>

<p>Current favorite language: Java (specifically JavaFX because I really enjoy creating clean and functional UX/UI)</p>
